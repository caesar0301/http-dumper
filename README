This program aims to dump the packets carrying HTTP traffic for later analysis.

The standard HTTP (80), HTTPs (443) and HTTP proxy (3128) ports are filtered out. 

The unencripted HTTP header and TCP header are saved as pcap format in the output file. If the HTTP header is not detected, only TCP header is 
and saved in the output file.
